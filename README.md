    Project ERP is an everday tool to manage your daily work with your purchases at your local supermarket.
    Who hasn't been confronted with the problem: You're at the supermarket and ask yourself - what should I buy
    How many eggs do I got left at home? Did I buy some apples the last time?
    This is where Project ERP comes in. You store your purchases at a database and can access it from all around
    the world. Just open the app and look into your pantry.
